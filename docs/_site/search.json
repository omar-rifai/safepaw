    "text": "Data Sources\nSeveral open data sources were used to construct instances for our optimization problem.\n\nDataset of french maternity wards [DREES (2025)]. This dataset contains yearly (10 years) info on deliveries_per_facility and the number of beds per facility. The type of maternity ward is also recorded (type 1, 2a, 2b, or 3).\nThe french national directory of health establishements list[Ministère Santé (2025)]. We use this dataset mainly to extract the coordinates of each maternity ward.\nStatistics on number of births by commune [INSEE (2025)]. This dataset allows us to set the lower bounds \\(d_{gr}\\) on our model’s demand.\nAdditional open data for precise coordinates of the regions, departments and communes in France.\n\nThe data sources have been synthesized in our project as two files 📄 summary_maternity_capacity.csv for the capacity in beds by facility and 📄 summary_maternity_labours.csv to extract the demand by commune.
